# Jenny's Manager README

## Welcome
This document is aimed mainly at those who work for me, but if you work with me or if I work for you, I'm happy you are here and reading my README! I hope this document serves as a helpful guide, or refresher, to me and how I like to manage.

## My Goal
My primary goal is to build a high-performing team that delivers consistent value to our organization while helping each team member grow professionally. I believe my job is to help you become better at your job. This means removing obstacles, providing context, connecting you with resources, and giving honest, timely feedback. 

As your manager, I will:
- Conduct meaningful 1:1s and help with goal creation
- Share context and updates from across the organization
- Find mentoring and development resources tailored to your needs
- Write thoughtful performance reviews and provide regular feedback
- Help ensure we've got our resources in the right place
- Keep engineering work "running on time" by identifying potential blockers and delays
- Implement training, development, and team building initiatives when needed

I want to create an environment where you can do your best work and develop your skills in the direction that interests you most.

## What I Value Most
I value transparency, ownership, and collaboration above all else. Helping me looks like proactively raising issues before they become problems, coming to meetings prepared, and being willing to both give and receive feedback.

When conflicts arise, I prefer to address them directly and promptly. I encourage team members to try resolving conflicts themselves first through honest, respectful conversation. If that doesn't work, I'm happy to facilitate a discussion. I believe most conflicts stem from misunderstandings or misaligned expectations, and I approach conflict resolution with curiosity rather than judgment.

Feedback is incredibly important to me. I give feedback from a place of concern and genuine desire to help you grow. I also expect you to give me feedback as often as I give it to you. Retrospectives are a crucial part of our feedback culture - I believe in making time to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how we can improve. Retros help us celebrate wins and address issues before they become patterns.

One of my weaknesses is that I can sometimes take on too much and spread myself thin. If you notice me overcommitting or missing details, please feel comfortable pointing it out. I also tend to process things verbally, which means I might think out loud in ways that can sometimes be confusing - if I'm not making sense, please ask me to clarify.

## My Expectations
I expect you to:
- Communicate proactively about your work, challenges, and needs
- Take ownership of your commitments and follow through
- Be curious and continuously learning
- Support your teammates and contribute to a positive team culture

For scheduling time with me, my calendar is up to date - feel free to book any open slot. For urgent matters, Slack is the best way to reach me.

When it comes to mistakes, I believe they're valuable learning opportunities. I expect you to own them, share what happened as soon as you're aware, and focus on solutions rather than blame. We'll work together to understand what went wrong and how to prevent similar issues in the future.

I define "Done" as work that has been tested, documented, and is ready to be used by its intended audience without further explanation. This includes meeting acceptance criteria, passing quality checks, and addressing edge cases.

I expect core working hours of 10am-4pm for synchronous collaboration, but I understand the need for flexibility. Outside those hours, respond to messages when you can. I don't expect immediate responses on evenings or weekends.

If you feel overwhelmed or under-utilized, please check in with me so we can adjust your workload.

## 1:1s
I hold weekly 1:1s with each team member, typically scheduled for 30 minutes. These meetings are primarily for you - you should bring the agenda and topics you want to discuss. I may occasionally have items to cover, but this is your time to get what you need from me.

1:1s are important to me. I will not cancel them (though I may occasionally need to reschedule). I'm happy for you to cancel so long as we touch base at least every few weeks.

The main focus of our 1:1s should be your growth, challenges, and well-being. This is not a status update meeting (we have other forums for that), but rather a place to discuss how things are going for you, what support you need, and your career development.

I encourage you to keep a running document of discussion points that we can both access and update. This helps us track our conversations and follow up on action items.

I believe all meetings should have a clear goal and outcome. Every meeting I organize will have an agenda and purpose, and I expect the same from you when you schedule meetings. I will experiment with the cadence and format of team meetings to find what works best for our needs and welcome your feedback on what's effective. 

As our primary focus should be product teams, I'll create regular touchpoints where we can share updates, take questions, and ensure we all have the same shared context. I'm always open to suggestions on how to make our collaboration more efficient and productive.
