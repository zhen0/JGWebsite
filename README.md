### Current (2019 - now)

I'm a Engineering Manager at [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), managing a full-stack team of 7 developers. 

I love working with engineers to create a high quality product and to build a happy and high-performing team. I've led engineers from across the stack, building out both our orchestration product and our web UI. I have helped hired great colleagues from junior devs to staff engineers. 

Before taking on management I was a front-end lead engineer. I still love coding and regularly build Prefect flows in Python and make contributions to our UI using Vue.js and Typescript. 

Before I joined Prefect in 2019, I was a software engineering student at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy in New York.  

I started coding after my husband persuaded me to join him in a Codecademy intensive course to learn Python. Although he didn't actually have time to finish the course, I loved it and decided I wanted to learn more. After a bit research, I found the Grace Hopper program and got excited about making a full time career of it. 

### Prior experience

Before I got the coding bug, I spent over ten years as a diplomat for the British government, where I had fun working in Beijing, China; reporting on the DPRK (and trying to help slow down it's nuclear program); helping the Mexican and Afghan governments build their own robust teams to counter corruption; and learning lots of fun things about detecting deception and negotiation. 


### Projects

[Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect): The Prefect python and vue.js open source code base. 

[Prefect-UI-Library](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-ui-library): The open source UI library that feeds into our main Prefect product.  This is the code that I and my team built over the last few years. 

[Prefect-Design](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-design): The open source Vue.js component library built and maintained by my team. 

[Python Murder Mystery](https://github.com/zhen0/PythonProjects): The project that started my love of code. Using Python I analyzed hand writing samples to find whose language use most closely matched that of the "murderer".


### Writing
