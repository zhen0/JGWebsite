### About Me

I'm Jennifer.  Also known as Jenny or Jen.

I'm a Engineering Manager at [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) and was previously a lead engineer focussing on our UI.  Before I joined Prefect in 2019, I was a software engineering student at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy in New York.  

I love working with engineers to create a high quality product and to build a happy and performant team. I've led engineers from across the stack at Prefect to build out both our orchestration product and our and UI and I have hired great engineers to work in the teams I lead. I still love coding and regularly build Prefect flows in python and make contributions to our UI using Vue.js and Typescript. 

I started coding after my husband persuaded me to join him in a Codecademy intensive course to learn python. Although he didn't actually have time to finish the course, I loved it and decided I wanted to learn more. After a bit research, I found the Grace Hopper program and got excited about the chance to learn to code. 

Before I got the coding bug, I spent over ten years as a diplomat for the British government, where I had fun working in Beijing, China; reporting on the DPRK (and trying to help slow down it's nuclear program); helping the Mexican and Afghan governments build their own robust teams to counter corruption; and learning lots of fun things about detecting deception and negotiation.
