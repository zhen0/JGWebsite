I know there are hundreds (maybe more!) of blogs posts out there about how people ended up in software engineering.  I know because I read many of them when I was thinking about taking the plunge and learning to code.  However, I also know that everyone’s journey is a little bit different and that finding someone who has a background or a situation like you can actually be pretty tough.  So I’m adding story to the hundreds of blogs already out there in the hope that it helps anyone who: 

- is a parent (or wants to be one!) and wants to believe they can manage childcare and their career;
- wants to be remote but is not sure how they can build connections;
- wants to find out a little bit more about what life is like at my company, Prefect.io

## My background

- diplomat
- daughter
- childcare!

## Deciding and learning

- Codecademy
- Grace Hopper

## Choosing a company

- Click on apply vs targeting - what I know now
- Interview them not just letting them interview you

## Growing at my company
