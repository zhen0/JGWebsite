## What is Baseball Bandersnatch?

Our second project in the senior phase at Grace Hopper is 'Stackathon' a two day (four day if you include the weekend) hackathon where we work on our own project and have the opportunity to try out using new technologies or languages.  We start on Thursday morning and present what we built on Monday morning.  

I decided to build a tool I had wanted as a high school teacher in NYC - an educational technology mobile phone app, that was aimed at my former baseball loving students.  The aim of the project is to engage students with a build-your-own baseball game story while also teaching them the grammar of "very" vs. "too". I built the app using React Native and Expo and you can see it on [Expo](https://expo.io/@jennyg/baseball).
